# firedetection-using-opencv-tensorflow-pythonML
This proposed statement is developed using DEEP LEARNING with the help of other libraries. The system is made capable of detecting fire using some predefined pramaters

Fire is one of the dangerous events which can result in great losses if it is not controlled on time.
 
 
•This necessitates the importance of developing early fire detection systems. Therefore, in this research article, we propose cost-effective fire detection CNN architecture for surveillance videos.
 
•The model is inspired from GoogleNet architecture and is fine-tuned with special focus on computational complexity and detection accuracy.
Through experiments, it is proved that the proposed architecture dominates the existing hand-crafted features based fire detection methods as well as the AlexNet architecture based fire detection method.
 
• Although, this work improved the flame detection accuracy, yet the number of false alarms is still high and further research is required in this direction.
 
•In addition, the current flame detection frameworks can be intelligently tuned for detection of both smoke and fire. This will enable the video surveillance systems to handle more complex situations in real-world.
